# Store-Sales-Data-Analysis-using----EXCEL

-- Overview
This project is all about analyzing store sales using a "Vrinda Store Analysis Dashboard". The dashboard gives clear insights into sales trends based on different factors like gender, age group, month, state, sales channel, and product category. Using "data visualization techniques", it helps businesses understand where their sales are coming from and how they can improve their strategies.

-- Key Insights
1. Gender-Based Sales Analysis
- Women make up 62% of total sales, while men contribute 38%.
- This shows that women are shopping more, so businesses can focus more on female-oriented products and marketing.

2. Age Group Sales Analysis
- Adults are the biggest contributors to sales.
- Sales from senior citizens and teenagers are quite low, meaning they are not the main target audience.

3. Monthly Sales Performance
- The highest sales were on 4th Jan and 5th Jan.
- There's a drop in sales in the middle of the month.
- Businesses can use this data to plan better discounts or promotional offers.

4. Sales by State
- Some states perform way better than others in terms of sales.
- Businesses can target high-performing states for further expansion or promotions.

5. Sales by Channel
- **Flipkart** is the top-performing sales platform, contributing **375,778** in total sales.
- Amazon, Meesho, Myntra, Nalli, and Others contribute less.
- Businesses should focus more on Flipkart or try to improve performance on other platforms.

6. Sales by Category
